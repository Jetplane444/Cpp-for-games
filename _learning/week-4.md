This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I want to start working with classes. I also want to add more movement to my main character, and hopefully I can implement my background into the game.

## Do

We made a player class which is nice because I can start implementing more movement to my character. we also added a moving camera with an image of my background

## Check

We actually worked on the things I wanted to achieve this week in the labs which was helpfull and made me create a good player class aswell as a moving camera. I've yet to add collision to the map and I also want to Add more moves to my player

## Act

I want to start trying things out more on my own, I've had luck this week with the lab following my couse of plan but I cant rely on that every week.
