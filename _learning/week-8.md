## Plan

I want my enemy to follow the player and add more states like attacking the player when near. I expect to spend 3 hours on this plus the 4 hours from the lectures.


## Do

sadly I have been sick this week so the only thing I added in my time outside of the lectures was bacground music, in the lesson we got the enemy to follow the player though, so I am proud of that. I mainly attended the lectures because of being sick, which took 4 hours in total

## Check

adding the music went quite well with a little bit of help, and the enemy follows the player. It's not perfect yet, since when the player stops moving the enemy stops on top of the player, It's nice if in the future the enemy slowy starts and stops basted on the player. 

## Act

I notice sometimes I just really don't know how to solve something such as with the enemy movement, so I want to read up on some principles in programming again in my c++ 20 book.
