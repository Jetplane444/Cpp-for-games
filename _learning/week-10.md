## Plan

I want to try and get the collisions/ LDtk working this week, I estimate that this will take me 5/6 hours plus 4 hours for the courses
## Do

I spent 10 hours on the project this week, most of the ldtk loading worked, but the camera didn't, so I ended not getting the collisions to work and resorted to using the image I already used as the background

## Check

Working on the code for ldtk went quite well, Jeremiah helped me tweak some things in my code so I could actually load ldtk on the screan, although this worked, we sadly found out that the camera didn't work with the ldtk loader so i opted for not using ldtk.

## Act

This was the last week of the course. Although I've definitevely decided to go for the game art course, I've developed a gread admiration for the art of proggraming in the last 10 weeks, and i will try to keep challenging myself in terms of programming.
