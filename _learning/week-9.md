## Plan

my goals this week are adding a state machine for the enemy, including trying to get all of the actions to work, and i want to atleast try and start with a level file for collision. I expect this will take me 4/5 hours plus 4 hours because of following the lectures.

## Do

I made the state machine in about 1.5 hours, and I was able to get the enemy to attack the player in the lectures, I also made a small start to the level file.
all in all, this took me about 6 hours in total this weekg

## Check

 Making the state machine went very well, I did this on my own and it works well, I got the enemy to move with some assistance. 

## Act

For now my last focus will be trying to get the LDtk map into the game/ the collisions of the LDtk file next week.
