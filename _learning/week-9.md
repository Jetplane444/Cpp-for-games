This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

my goals this week are adding a state machine for the enemy, including trying to get all of the actions to work, and i want to atleast try and start with a level file for collision. I expect this will take me 4/5 hours plus 4 hours because of following the lectures.

## Do

I made the state machine in about 1.5 hours, and I was able to get the enemy to attack the plauyer in the lectures, I also made a small start to the level file.
all in all, this took me about 6 hours in total this weekg
