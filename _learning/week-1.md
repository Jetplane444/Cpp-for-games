This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I'd like to finish my introduction This week.
I also want to get to know some basics on C++, as well as knowing a bit more about what goes into programming a game from scratch. This together will at least take about 3 hours. Of course 2 hours for the course day as well as writing my introduction. I'd also like to work on an assignment if we are given one on thursday.


## Do

 I was able to finish my introduction on my website this week, this took me about 1/1.5 hours. I had a small issue where my updates wouldnt push to the website, but I quicly resolved this issue. I also finished my game description document for now, including mockup of what the game would look like. this took me a bit longer that I expected, about 2/3 hours. I also took some more time looking at datatypes and variables, since I was a bit confused about what data types you need to use for different numbers.

## Check

I finished both my introduction as well as my GDD, both went relatively smootly appart from a small hiccup with pushing my changes to my profile, but I solved this quickly. I also read and watched information about the concepts that we learned this week.

## Act

Up until now I've been able to follow allong with everything we did, I am proud of finishing my GDD relatively early. However, I feel like the coming weeks we are going to be picking up pace, and I need to keep in mind that I have to plan the stuff I want to get done so I have a good overview of my projects and workload.
