This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I'd like to finish my introduction This week.
I also want to get to know some basics on C++, as well as knowing a bit more about what goes into programming a game from scratch. This together will at least take about 3 hours. Of course 2 hours for the course day as well as writing my introduction. I'd also like to work on an assignment if we are given one on thursday.


## Do

 I was abkle to finish my introduction on my website this week, this took me about 1/1.5 hours. I had a small issue where my updates wouldnt push to the website, but I quicly resolved this issue. I also finished my game game description document for now, including mockup of the game. this took me a bit longer that I expected, about 2/3 hours. I also took some more time looking at datatypes and variables, since I was a bit confused about what data types you need to use for different numbers.
