## Plan

I want to make my own sprite move, and I want to work on my game background in LDtk. I think this will take me about 5 hours plus 4 hours in the lectures.

## Do

I was able to make my character move, and even better than I thought, because she has an idle animation when standing still and she runs when you move her. I am also happy with how the background of the game is comming along. I worked on the project for about 8 hours this week

## Check

I finished the background for now, and  am happy with making my character move. I havent made the background move yet. 

## Act

I want to start working with classes and I need to get to know operators better.
