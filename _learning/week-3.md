This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I want to make my own sprite move, and I want to work on my game background

## Do

I was able to make my character move, and even better than I thought, because she has an idle animation when standing still and she runs when you move her. I am also happy with how the background of the game is comming along.
