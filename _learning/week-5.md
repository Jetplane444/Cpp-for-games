This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I want to work on collisions in my background and add an enemy class. Id also like to work on more player movement if there is time.

## Do

So far I've added an enemy class, which is very close to the player class so I hope to tweak it to make it act like an enemy. currenly the sprite and status are fixed to the upper left corner so its barely visible, I have to look into positioning and how enemys stay in place with a moving camera
