## Plan

I want to work on collisions in my background and add an enemy class. Id also like to work on more player movement if there is time. This will probably take me about 9 hours in total.

## Do

So far I've added an enemy class, which is very close to the player class so I hope to tweak it to make it act like an enemy. currenly the sprite and status are fixed to the upper left corner so its barely visible, I have to look into positioning and how enemys stay in place with a moving camera. I worked on the project for about 9/10 hours in total this week.

## Check

We worked on an entity class so that the enemy class isn't so similair to the player, I worked on the player movement, so now she can idle, walk, and attack with inputs.

## Act

I feel like I am getting more independent in problem solving and would like to continue growing in that.
