## Plan

I want to get my enemy to move and I want to see if I can add dashing to my player. I estimate this will take me 3/4 hours plus 4 hours from the lectures.

## Do

We got to get the enemy moving in the lesson, but it doesnt follow the player yet. I fixed dashing on my own, I did ask questions but solved my issues before I got assistance which I am proud of. I also solved an issue with the enemy animation and set its ancor so it can run towards the right direction. I ended up working on my project for 8 hours this week.

## Check

I thought I would get a bit further with the enemy movement but I am proud of that it moves in general. I am proud of adding the dash on my own.

## Act

I'd like to strengthen my independent problem solving, because some things I can solve quite well on my own, such as dashing, but I did need quite a bit of help for the enemy movement.
