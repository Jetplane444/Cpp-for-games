## Plan

I want to get my enemy to move and I want to see if Iz can add dashing to my player.

## Do

We got to get the enemy moving in the lesson, but it doesnt follow the player yet. I fixed dashing on my own, I did ask questions but solved my issues before I got assistance which I am proud of. I also solved an issue with the enemy animation and set its ancor so it can run towards the right direction.

## Check

I thought I would get a bit further with the enemy movement but I am proud of that it moves in general. I am proud of adding the dash on my own.

## Act
