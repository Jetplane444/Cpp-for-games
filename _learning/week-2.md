This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I'd like to get feed back on my GDD, as wel as maybe starting programming more, at least in the lab, I want to learn more about the subjects of this week, such as pionters, references and arrays. We are also going to learn about Function classes.

## Do

I got good feedback about my GDD, and I incorporated the feedback into my GDD. I feel like I'm understanding more and more about the use of the concepts that we have learned so far by also doing the labs.

## Check

I am happy about the GGD feedback i got. I had some issues with moving a sprite and displaying the fps from the lab but this has been solved.


## Act

Sometimes I feel like im underestimating myself, but I do feel like with enough effort i can make an nice game. I shouldn't be affraid of asking questions.
