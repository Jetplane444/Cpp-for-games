## Introduction

Hi, my name is Jetske, I finished havo in the summer of 2023. I have a gap year right now and I'd love to do the game art course at Buas in 2024. I want to learn programming because I feel like it will help me a lot in the future. I have some ideas for games that I'd like to actually make a working version of. Although I plan on taking the game art course, I think it is valuable for me to be able to program. 

## Strengths

I am quite good at teaching myself things. I don’t give up easily when I have to solve a problem, I try finding a solution myself unless I have no other choice. I thrive in both a solo and team environment. I am creative and love creating both 2D and 3D art.

## Weakness

I find myself having a lot of ideas. I am passionate about these ideas which sometimes causes me to underestimate the effort and time that these ideas ask of me. I also feel like I overestimate problems, which causes me to get stuck on simple problems. I also struggle with concentration, especially longer periods of time.

## Accomplishments

I won a contest at school with a few friends which consisted of solving a problem for Dierentuin Amersfoort. I used to do archery for a while. My Tetris high score is 3 million.
I taught myself guitar, and I am getting better and better at 3D art.


## Hobbies

I love gaming (shocker). Currently my favourite game franchise is The Last of Us. Although I have been enjoying Hades and Elden Ring as well this summer. I have been playing the guitar for about three years now, and I also like to drum occasionally. My favourite music genres are Rock and Folk, and my favourite artists are currently Radiohead, The Foo Fighters, and Hozier.


## Career Goals

I’d like to work in a studio that specialises in story focused or open world games, something like Fromsoftware or Naughty Dog. I’d love to work on a variety of things, mainly art. If I do end up in a programming oriented role, I’d like to program gameplay. I would enjoy staying in the Netherlands, but I am also interested in working on games in Japan for a while.
